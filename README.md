## Project Overview
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In this project, I gathered tweet data in a variety of different sources from the Twitter Account [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), one of which was querying popularity measures using Twitters API tweepy. Further steps included assessing and cleaning the datasets to have a clean master dataset to produce trustworthy analyses in the form of (multidimensional) exploratotory as well as explanatory visualisations.
